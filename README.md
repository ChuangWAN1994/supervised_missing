# On the consistency of supervised learning with missing values

This is the code corresponding to the preprint arXiv:1902.06931, especially section 6: simulations.

There are two boxplots and one consistency figure. For each one, there are three separate files: one containing the functions, one containing the computation (parallelized for loop, but with one core per forest), and one for the visualisation.
